## go语言的简单介绍overview

### 介绍（Introduction）

Go is a procedural programming language. It was developed in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google but launched in 2009 as an open-source programming language. Programs are assembled by using packages, for efficient management of dependencies. This language also supports environment adopting patterns alike to dynamic languages. For eg., type inference (y := 0 is a valid declaration of a variable y of type float).

go语言是一种面向过程的编程语言。Go是在2007年由Robert Griesemer、Rob Pike和Ken Thompson在google开发的，并且在2009年通过开放源码的形式对外发布的一种新的编程语言。它的程序使用包进行组装，并以此作为高效管理依赖的方式。它对类似动态语言的环境进行了支持


### 优势（Why this “Go language”?）

Because Go language is an effort to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing

因为Go语言致力于去糅合交互式的、动态类型语言的便利性和静态的、编译型语言的安全性。它还希望做到更现代化、支持网络开发和多核CPU计算。

### go语言当中不存在的问题

- Go attempts to reduce the amount of typing in both senses of the word. Throughout its design, developers tried to
- reduce clutter and complexity
- There are no forward declarations and no header files; everything is declared exactly once.
- Stuttering is reduced by simple type derivation using the := declare-and-initialize construct.
- There is no type hierarchy: types just are, they don’t have to announce their relationships.

go尝试避免同义的代码形式，通过它的设计，开发者可以避免出现混乱和复杂
没有前向声明，也没有头文件；一切都只声明一次。

没有类型继承，类型只是代表他们自己，这些类型不必要去声明他们之间的关系

### 硬件限制

We have observed that in a decade, the hardware and processing configuration is changing at a very slow rate. In 2004, P4 was having the clock speed of 3.0 GHz and now in 2018, Macbook pro has the clock speed of Approx (2.3Ghz v 2.66Ghz). To speed up, the functionality we use more processors, but using more processor the cost also increases. And due to this we use limited processors and using limited processor we have a heavy programming language whose threading takes more memory and slows down the performance of our system. Hence, to overcome such problem Golang has been designed in such a way that instead of using threading it uses Goroutine, which is similar to threading but consumes very less memory.
Like threading consumes 1MB whereas Goroutine consumes 2KB of memory, hence at the same time, we can have millions of goroutine triggered.
So the above-discussed point makes golang a strong language that handles concurrency like C++ and Java.

我们注意到，近十年来，硬件和处理配置正在以十分缓慢的速度发展。在2004年，P4的时钟速度为3.0GHz,而现在在2018年，Macbook pro 的时钟速度为 Approx (2.3Ghz v 2.66Ghz)
为了加快速度，我们使用更多处理器的功能，但使用更多处理器成本也会增加。由于这个原因，我们限制了处理器的数量，并且由于对处理器使用的限制，我们必须使更多的代码，而这些线程还会占用更多的内存，从而拖慢系统运行的效率。也是由于这个原因，GO被设计成使用携程运行而不是线程。
相同的程序任务下，线程使用1MB的内存，但携程对内存的消耗只有2KB，因此在同样的时间里面，我们可以触发更多的携程。
因此基于上述论述，golang被设计成一种强大的，像C++和Java一样用于处理并发的语言。

### Go语言的优缺点

#### 优点
- Flexible- It is concise, simple and easy to read. （灵活的，简洁、简单、容易阅读）
- Concurrency- It allows multiple process running simultaneously and effectively.（并发）
- Quick Outcome- Its compilation time is very fast.（快速编译）
- Library- It provides a rich standard library.（丰富的标准库）
- Garbage collection- It is a key feature of go. Go excels in giving a lot of control over memory allocation and has
  dramatically reduced latency in the most recent versions of the garbage collector.（垃圾回收）
- It validates for the interface and type embedding.（内置的接口和类型校验）

#### 缺点
- It has no support for generics, even if there are many discussions about it.（不支持泛型）
- The packages distributed with this programming language is quite useful but Go is not so object-oriented in the
  conventional sense.（包的分发功能做的不够友好）
- There is absence of some libraries especially a UI tool kit.（缺少一些库）

### 使用Go开发的应用
- Docker: a set of tools for deploying linux containers
- Openshift: a cloud computing platform as a service by Red Hat.
- Kubernetes: The future of seamlessly automated deployment processes
- Dropbox: migrated some of their critical components from Python to Go.
- Netflix: for two part of their server architecture.
- InfluxDB: is an open-source time series database developed by InfluxData.
- Golang: The language itself was written in Go.

### Go语言的特征
- 包管理
- 语言设计简单
- 静态类型
- 强大的标准库
- 跨平台
- 提供测试工具
